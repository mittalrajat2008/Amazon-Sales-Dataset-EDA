# Summary
Our insightful exploration of the Amazon Sales dataset, characterized by its remarkable cleanliness and consistency, yielded a treasure trove of findings. Through a series of targeted inquiries, we unlocked detailed answers and shed light on previously veiled aspects of the data and findings as follows:

Q1: What is the average rating for each product category?
Answer 1:
The output shows that most product categories have generally positive customer feedback, with average ratings above 3.50. However, some categories (e.g., 2 and 3) have lower ratings, suggesting potential areas for improvement. Further analysis of these categories could help identify specific reasons for lower feedback and identify potential solutions.

Q2: What are the top rating_count products by category?
Answer 2:
- The output highlights products likely to be popular within their categories based on high review counts, suggesting customer interest and engagement.
- Review counts range from 9 to 15867, implying varying levels of attention and feedback across products.
- Most listed products have ratings above 3.5, indicating a generally positive customer experience.
- Products with the highest review counts within their categories might be considered potential top sellers, even without direct sales data.

 Q3: What is the distribution of discounted prices vs. actual prices?
Answer 3:
- The output shows that discounted prices are generally lower than actual prices, with a median discounted price of $200 and a median actual price of $400.
- The discount percentage distribution is skewed to the left, with most products having a discount of 30% or less.
- The output suggests that there may be opportunities to increase discounted prices or discount percentages to attract more customers.

  Q4: How does the average discount percentage vary across categories?
Answer 4:
- Average discount percentages vary widely across categories, ranging from 0% to 78.39%.
- Categories 1 and 3 stand out with notably higher average discounts (78.39% and 56.34%), suggesting potential factors like clearance efforts, high competition, or lower-profit margins.
- Categories 0, 206, 207, 210 have average discounts of 0%, indicating consistent pricing or strong demand for products within those categories.
- Other categories exhibit varying discount percentages, likely reflecting diverse pricing strategies and market dynamics.

- USB connectivity, charging (especially fast charging), and cables are prominent product features.
- Prepositions and conjunctions like "with", "for", "and", "to" suggest a focus on explaining product compatibility and usage scenarios.

- Some reviews express both positive and negative aspects within the same text, like "Like and happy,,Please don't buy this heater" (product_id 1237), suggesting a nuanced evaluation of the product.
- The user_id column seems to contain commas, indicating multiple user IDs for some reviews. This might need investigation to ensure accuracy.
- Reviews for product_id 22, 152, and 723 have identical content, suggesting potential data duplication or errors.

  Q8: What is the correlation between discounted_price and rating?
